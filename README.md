# Chat_application
This is a simple chat application between 2 or more terminals which are on the same ip address.
Needed to have 2 scripts `server.py` for server and `client.py` for clients.
### 1. Activating server.
You need to run `server.py` with ```python3 server.py```, it will wait for clients to connect to it.
### 2. Running clients.
Run ```python3 client.py```, enter a nickname and you will get connected to server.
You can create as much clients as you want.
Now you can get in touch via terminals.
### 3. Disconnect from server.
If you want to disconnect from server, simply input `ctrl c` on keyboard.
